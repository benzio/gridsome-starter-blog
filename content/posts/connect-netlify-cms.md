Fortunately, I've been working with the Github and deploying to Netlify long enough now that I no longer clench up when a build fails. Knowing that this entire process of putting together a static website is a learning process also helps. 

However, when trying to connect this blog to Netlify CMS, the build fails each time due to a discrepancy with core-js and, unfortunately, there are no gridsome-specific issues floating around out there to troubleshoot the issue.
